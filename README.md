## Overview

Bash‚ÄëCI is a lightweight, minimalistic CI/CD system implemented in Bash scripts and NGINX with FastCGI. It was built as a pedagogical tool to show how one might build a CI/CD pipeline from scratch using familiar Unix tools and shell scripting without using production-grade systems and frameworks.

The goal is **not** to replace production-grade systems (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.), but rather to serve as a learning exercise and demonstration of core principles.

---

## Features

- Execute build/test/deploy pipelines using shell scripts  
- Lightweight footprint
- Easy to inspect, understand, and extend  
- Basic support for notifications and logs
- Docker integration 
- Basic HTTP interface

---

## Architecture & Design

- NGINX/FastCGI exposes an endpoint (implemented by a Bash script) that is called by GitHub (webhook) on every commit to the [demo-app](https://github.com/malipio/demo-app) repository 
- A build is triggered (by calling a custom Bash script)
- Once build is finished a GitHub comment is added to relevant commit-sha
- Logs and build output are available on NGINX server

---

## Requirements

- A UNIX‚Äëlike environment (Linux, macOS)  
- Bash (version ‚â• 4 recommended)  
- Docker & Docker Compose

---

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Add relevant secrets to `.env` folder
3. Build Docker images and start services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
4. Setup a webhook in GitHub
   
---

## Usage

1. Push changes to your repository  
2. Bash‚ÄëCI detects changes via webhook
3. The pipeline is executed
4. Logs and status are persisted
5. Pipeline status is communicated using github comment functionality
